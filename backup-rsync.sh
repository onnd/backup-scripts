# Script for backing up a set of directories to a remote host.
# Based on someone's blog, but I can't remember where.
#
# Every time the script is run a new directory will be created on the remote host and the source files will be copied here.
# Each file copied will first be compared with the corresponding file in the last backup.
# If the file is unchanged (defined by timestamp, size & attributes) the file will not be copied, and instead a hard link will
# be created to the previously copied file, on the remote host.
#
# Assumes ssh keys have been exchanged.

# TIP: If the timestamps have been messed up and you need to back up, use --checksum, otherwise everything will get re-copied
